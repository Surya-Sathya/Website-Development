    <div class="paraFlexbox">
      <div><p>
            The sleeper has awakened. The ominous chiming of an all too careless bedroom clock pierces submerged silence. 
            Sputtering whirrs of a computer fan cough oil and grime. Test cases, The Terminal burns, of those blood-stained-scriptures, 
            they cast crimson and probe into slits that once held pupils of a being all too consumed by unbridled madness. 
            A foul wretched, reek escapes taut, pale skin. Lean closer into the horrors, bare witness to a doom. 
            A macabre clicking of vertebrae ensues as your spine contorts deeper, deeper, deeper… 
            And there you are, you ghoul of the night, you’ve had a cream of a nightmare dream and you’ve got the hoo-ha’s coming to you. 
            Chimes, Chimes, Chimes, a Harbinger of Inexorable Time… A bloody heart pounds against Dry Bones… Fear the Maker and His Wake…

      <div><p class="subarticletitlesFlexbox">🤯 WHY CODING ASSIGNMENTS AREN’T AS BAD AS YOU THINK 🤯</p></div>

      <div><p>
        The passage above is what you may describe as an average computer science student’s night, working on a barely finished, 
        inefficient, non-functional coding assignment. These large chunks of tasks bundled together and thrown your way a couple times 
        a semester arguably cause more anxiety to computer science students than the state of the job market, inflation and showers combined 
        (🤢 Sorry not sorry 🤢). Some coding tasks can be so laughably obtuse and difficult with pedantic marking schemes that even the most 
        resilient among us struggle to find the willpower to complete them. One would not be wrong to question, why are universities across the 
        world still assigning these projects to “teach” content? Surely there must be a better way for us to learn these important and, frankly, 
        very engaging and interesting concepts, so that we can succeed in job interviews and stoke our passion for programming. 
      </div></p>

      <div><p>
        I too believed in the sentiment that coding assignments were torture devives that emerged from the mouths of Shai-Hulud (Can you tell I like Dune 😉). 
        However after some in-depth research on pedagogy, and learning philosophies birthed from the bathtubs of ancient greece philosophers 
        and the dusty M.I.T computer labs of the 60’s, I have begun to appreciate the structure of coding assignments and the manner in which 
        they teach us important concepts.

      <div><p class="subarticletitlesFlexbox">🤓 INTRODUCTION TO CONSTRUCTIONISM (WITH AN “S”) 🤓</p></div>
      <div><p>
        The reason I am playing this devil’s advocate role (👺) is because I believe coding assignments at Monash University follow a 
        “Constructionist” method of teaching. The theory of constructionism describes “student-centred, discovery learning where students 
        use what they already know to acquire more knowledge.” (Wikipedia, 2024). This learning theory was established and heavily worked 
        on by Seymour Papert; computer scientist, mathematician, artificial intelligence pioneer, MIT professor (Britanica, 2024) and the 
        man who developed constructionist learning, based on the theory of constructivism through the teachings of pedagogist 
        (a word describing an expert in the theory and methods behind learning acquisition, especially in early adolescence in our Seymour’s case) Jean Piaget.
