            The sleeper has awakened. The ominous chiming of an all too careless bedroom clock pierces submerged silence. 
            Sputtering whirrs of a computer fan cough oil and grime. Test cases, The Terminal burns, of those blood-stained-scriptures, 
            they cast crimson and probe into slits that once held pupils of a being all too consumed by unbridled madness. 
            A foul wretched, reek escapes taut, pale skin. Lean closer into the horrors, bare witness to a doom. 
            A macabre clicking of vertebrae ensues as your spine contorts deeper, deeper, deeper‚Ä¶ 
            And there you are, you ghoul of the night, you‚Äôve had a cream of a nightmare dream and you‚Äôve got the hoo-ha‚Äôs coming to you. 
            Chimes, Chimes, Chimes, a Harbinger of Inexorable Time‚Ä¶ A bloody heart pounds against Dry Bones‚Ä¶ Fear the Maker and His Wake‚Ä¶

      <div><p>
        The passage above is what you may describe as an average computer science student‚Äôs night, working on a barely finished, 
        inefficient, non-functional coding assignment. These large chunks of tasks bundled together and thrown your way a couple times 
        a semester arguably cause more anxiety to computer science students than the state of the job market, inflation and showers combined 
        (ü§¢ Sorry not sorry ü§¢). Some coding tasks can be so laughably obtuse and difficult with pedantic marking schemes that even the most 
        resilient among us struggle to find the willpower to complete them. One would not be wrong to question, why are universities across the 
        world still assigning these projects to ‚Äúteach‚Äù content? Surely there must be a better way for us to learn these important and, frankly, 
        very engaging and interesting concepts, so that we can succeed in job interviews and stoke our passion for programming.
